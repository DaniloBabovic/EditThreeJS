Productivity features:
* Runtime editing
* Position, rotation, scale
* Grouping
* Materials

Editor writes javascript for:
* lights
* single Object3D
* all Object3D

Main goal is to start with a new project a little bit faster.

There are Project files and Edit files in separate folders.
When you are done with editor you can remove Editor folder.

Editor auto-generate javascript code for file lights.js and load_scene.is located in the project directoru.
You will get auto-generated code for lights.js and load_scene.js but you must manually overwrite it.

Happy coding!
